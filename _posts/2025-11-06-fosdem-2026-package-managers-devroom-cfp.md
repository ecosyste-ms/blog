We are excited to announce the Call for Participation for the Package Managers devroom at FOSDEM 2026, taking place on **Saturday, 31st January 2026** at the Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.

**Submission deadline: 1st December 2025**

## About the Devroom

Package managers are critical infrastructure for developers and end users alike, handling dependency resolution, licensing, reproducibility, provenance, software supply chain security, and long-term maintainability. As ecosystems proliferate, package managers face recurring challenges: dependency solving, namespace collisions, reproducibility, metadata standards, binary vs. source builds, supply chain security, and cryptographic signing of artifacts.

The Free and Open Source community has built dozens of package managers across operating systems (Debian's APT, Fedora's DNF, Arch's pacman, Nix, Guix), programming language ecosystems (PyPI/pip/uv, npm, Cargo, RubyGems, Conda, Pixi), domain-specific tools (Spack, EasyBuild for HPC), and universal formats (Flatpak, Snap, AppImage). Each has made unique trade-offs and innovations.

This devroom provides a gathering place for maintainers, researchers, and users of package managers to discuss lessons learned, new developments, and common infrastructure challenges. It's a neutral forum where different communities can meet, exchange ideas, and foster collaboration on universal issues.
