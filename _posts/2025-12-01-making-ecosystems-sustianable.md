Yesterday we announced that [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms) was introducing rate limits and paid-for access. Today we’d like to talk about the supporting work we’re doing to make [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms) sustainable for the for foreseeable future:

**Supporting contributors**

For three years [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms) has been developed and maintained by a single developer, and we’re sure it shows. So, for the last two months, our latest recruit James Smith has been stepping repeatedly on metaphorical rakes like the proverbial Sideshow Bob, documenting, standardising and improving the developer and contributor experience, and in time, easing the path for future maintainers of [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms).

If you’re interested in operating your own instance of [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms), or would like to become a contributor check out our documentation at [https://docs.ecosyste.ms/](https://docs.ecosyste.ms/) 

**Supporting maintainers**

At the same time we’ve been building the human and policy infrastructure to support the community of contributors and maintainers we want to build, [enumerating our values in a charter,](https://docs.ecosyste.ms/docs/about/charter) adopting a [standard community code of conduct](https://docs.ecosyste.ms/docs/contributing/conduct), and documenting a simple [governance policy](https://docs.ecosyste.ms/docs/about/governance). We established a project steering and technical committee to support community inclusion, and accountability — which we’ll be expanding in the coming months.

Importantly our new governance structure gives every maintainer a voice in how the project is run, as voting members.

**Supporting the service**

Finally, as you saw yesterday, we’re rate limiting access to [ecossyte.ms](http://ecossyte.ms)’ services and introducing a new commercial product to support the project financially. We’re also providing for Sponsors to become a part of our governance structure, inviting them to participate as members on our steering committee, bringing them close to the operations and finances of our non-profit business.
