**In order to cover the cost of operating and maintaining ecosyste.ms today we’re introducing rate limits and paid API access tiers.**

Two months ago [we announced that we would be introducing rate limits](https://blog.ecosyste.ms/2025/09/01/rate-limiting-the-right-way.html) to help cover the cost of maintaining the service. Today we’re introducing those rate limits alongside paid-for tiers for users building and scaling services based on ecosyste.ms data. 

Users are still able to make up to X calls per hour anonymously across all ecosyste.ms services combined. We continue to operate a polite pool of users who will receive priority during peak periods. 

Users wishing to make up to 5,000 calls per hour can purchase increased rate limits through our self-service process available at [ecosyste.ms/pricing](http://ecossyte.ms/pricing). Users can register, select, and pay for their chosen tier using Stripe’s checkout, supporting most payment methods. From there users can generate and manage API access tokens to be used with any of ecosyste.ms services.

Users who require an invoice, a commercial licence, and/or higher rate limits can get in touch with us at [hello@ecosyste.ms](mailto:hello@ecosyste.ms).
