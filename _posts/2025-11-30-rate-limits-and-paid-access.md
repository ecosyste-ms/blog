**In order to cover the cost of operating and maintaining ecosyste.ms we’re introducing rate limits and paid API access tiers.**

Two months ago [we announced that we would be introducing rate limits](https://blog.ecosyste.ms/2025/09/01/rate-limiting-the-right-way.html) to help cover the cost of maintaining ecosyste.ms. Today we’re introducing those rate limits alongside paid-for tiers for users building and scaling services based on ecosyste.ms data. 

Users are still able to make up to 300 calls per hour across all ecosyste.ms services combined, and we continue to operate a polite pool of users who will receive priority during peak periods. 

Users wishing to make more calls per hour can purchase increased rate limits through our self-service process available at [ecosyste.ms/pricing](http://ecossyte.ms/pricing). Users can register, select, and pay for their chosen tier using Stripe’s checkout, supporting most payment methods. From there you can generate and manage API access tokens to be used with any of ecosyste.ms' services.

Users who require an invoice, a commercial licence, or higher rate limits can get in touch with us at [hello@ecosyste.ms](mailto:hello@ecosyste.ms).
